Through this project that is "Data-Science Project with Pandas Movies Dataset", I split it into 5 main parts, each part is independent of the other.
My goal is for the project to be more clear and more understandable according to a data science project and his challenge.


Part1 :" Explanatory Data Analysis & Data Presentation "


   * Data Import and first Inspection

   * Filtering the Dataset and find the best/worst n Movies with the: Highest Revenue, Lowest Profit, Highest Budget, Highest Return on Investment... 

   * Filtering the Dataset for movies that meet the specifique conditions like :
     - Science Fiction Action Movie with Bruce Willis
     - Certain movie with a certain director or actor
     - The best production studio in some years

   *  Analyze the Dataset and find out whether Franchises (Movies that belong to a collection) are more successful than stand-alone movies in terms of certain criteria ( mean revenue median Return on Investment ...)

   * Finding Most Successful Directors
----------------------------------------------------------

Part2 : " Data Import Working with APIs and JSON "
The second part of the project involves dealing in general with : 


   * Importing Data from JSON files

   * Working with APIs and JSON

------------------------------------------------------------

Part3 :" Data Cleaning Tidy up messy Datasets "


   * Dropping irrelevant Columns

   * Handle stringified JSON columns

   * Flatten nested Columns

   * Clean Numerical Columns

   * Clean Columns with DateTime Information

   * Clean String Text Columns

   * Remove Duplicates

   * Handle Missing Values & Removing ObervationsRows

   * Save our new clean dataset

-----------------------------------------------------


Project 4: " Merging & Cleaning & Transforming Data "
Through this project, we will accomplish the following important tasks:


   * Preparing the Data for Merge

   * Merging the Data Left Join

   * Cleaning and Transforming the new Cast Column

   * Cleaning and Transforming the new Crew Column
   
   * Save the new and clean DataSet
------------------------

Project 5: Working with Pandas and SQL Databases (Movies Dataset)

  In this project we will load data from databases and to pandas dataFrame, and we will adapt our requests to obtain only the database data we really need for our analysis. We shall therefore cover more than database loading data. It's actually all about improving memory and performance efficiency by working with pandas and secure databases in paralle# Data-Science-Project-with-Pandas-
